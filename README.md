# Invasive Species Trapping Model

## Overview
This research project aims to develop a model for determining optimal trap placement to combat the growth of invasive species. The model builds upon the existing system, [Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS)](https://github.com/lily-x/PAWS-public), and utilizes simulated data generated by a Lotka-Volterra-based model.

## Motivation
Invasive species pose a significant threat to ecosystems and biodiversity. Traditional methods of combating their growth often involve manual intervention, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. By leveraging advanced modeling techniques, this project aims to provide a data-driven approach to trap placement, optimizing the effectiveness of invasive species control efforts.

## Features
- Integration with PAWS: The model will be built on top of the existing PAWS system, leveraging its modeling and functionality.
- Simulated Data: The model will utilize simulated data generated from a Lotka-Volterra model, which captures the dynamics of predator-prey relationships.
- Trap Placement Optimization: The model will analyze the simulated data to determine the most effective locations for placing traps, maximizing the chances of capturing invasive species.
